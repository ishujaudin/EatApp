## 🏗️ Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern for clean separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│       View      │◄──►│   ViewModel      │◄──►│      Model      │
│   (SwiftUI)     │    │ (ObservableObject)│    │  (API/Data)     │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 🚀 Key Technologies
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive programming and data binding
- **Alamofire**: HTTP networking library
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for API calls
- **Core Data**: Local data persistence (if needed)

### 📡 API Integration
The app integrates with the Eat App API:

#### Restaurant Listing
```
GET https://api.eat-sandbox.co/consumer/v2/restaurants?region_id=3906535a-d96c-47cf-99b0-009fc9e038e0
```

#### Restaurant Details
```
GET https://api.eat-sandbox.co/consumer/v2/restaurants/:id
```

### 🎭 Presentation Layer Pattern
Implemented a clean presentation layer that transforms raw API responses into view-friendly models:

```swift
// API Response Model
struct RestaurantData {
    let attributes: RestaurantAttributes
    let id: String
}

// Presentation Model
struct RestaurantPresentation: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    let imageUrl: String
    let cuisine: String
    let priceLevel: PriceLevelPresentation
    let location: LocationPresentation
    let rating: RatingPresentation
    
    init(from restaurant: RestaurantData) {
        // Transform API data to presentation format
    }
}
```

### 🔄 State Management
- **AppState**: Global application state
- **ViewModels**: Screen-specific state management
- **@Published Properties**: Reactive UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states
